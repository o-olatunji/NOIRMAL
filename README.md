# Noirmal  

Noirmal, pronounced "normal" is the premeir app for made for black by black women. While America's beauty standards perpetuate the idea that white is the ultimate reach. The beauty industry in particularly has suggested that dark skin isn't "normal." We created a platform to help women find the shades of brown that prove black is the new black. 

##About Us 

In 2013, Dove released a set of body products with the tag line "for normal to dark skin," implying that dark skin is abnormal. Noirmal is a the response brown girls around the world have been waiting for, proving that our hues are beautiful and normal too. We help women find the products they need - from the perfect lipsticks, to nude lingerie, from skin colored band-aids to gold bronzers. Even better, we have tutorials and other videos to help our users upload, share, and explore the movement beyond products made for us. 

##Features

###Parse Backend
We implemented used Parse instead of Firebase to host our backend data. Parse allowed us to create and save PFUsers and PFObjects. We then queried data from the data base to print within our application.

###Video Broadcast
We use webviews to display youtube content withing our "Tutorials" section. Eventually, we plan to use the Youtube SDK in order to search through playlists and channels with our app. 

###MapKit 
We used MapKit to allow users to search for stores near their location. We hope to populate our MapKit with all of the stores carrying our products (endorsed or not). 

 
 ## Future Features:
YoutubeSDK
PinterestSDK
PhotoLibrary Framework 
Macy's Integration 
Coupons etc!
